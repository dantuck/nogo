nogo
====

nogo is a command line utility that will create and parse a directory of
markdown files for simplified organized note taking. nogo will maintain a
simple directory structure and will launch your editor of choice to edit your
notes.

## Examples

### Help

Get some help

```
~ nogo

nogo - the notes helper

actions:

  nogo help

  nogo new
  nogo new [topic]
  nogo new [topic] [event]

  nogo ls
  nogo ls [topic]

  nogo edit
  nogo edit [topic]
  nogo edit [topic] [note name substring]
```

### Browse your existing notes

List the topics that you've created (similar to Evernote's notebooks)
```
~ nogo ls

all topics:
   meetings
   reference
```

List the individual notes in a specific topic. Note that what you pass as the
argument can be a substring of the actual topic as well and `nogo` will find it
```
~ nogo ls reference

notes in reference:
   golang
   python
```

### Create a new note

Create a new file with no arguments
```
~ nogo new
Enter the notes topic: reference
Enter the event name: ruby
```

Create a new file with some arguments
```
~ nogo new reference ruby
~
```

### Edit existing notes

Edit a note with substring of both the topic and the individual note
```
~ nogo edit ref py
~
```

Edit a note in a specific topic, even when you don't remember what it was
called
```
~ nogo edit reference

Files in reference:
   golang
   python

What file would you like to edit in reference? python
```

## Completion and substrings

Most `nogo` commands don't actually require you to write out the whole topic
or event name. For example, if you have a topic "meetings" and an event
"meeting with my manager about cats", you can type `nogo edit mee cats` and
`nogo` will automatically find the note you're looking for.

## Configuration

### Editor

By default, this is set to `vim`. If you don't like `vim`, you can set the
`$EDITOR` environment variable to your test based editor of choice. You likely
already have this set (to `vim` or `emacs` for example) if you use the command
line to do things that require you to edit files.

### Notes path

By default, this is set to be `~/notes`. Simply set the `NOGODIR` environment
variable if you'd like this to be different.

```
export NOGODIR="/Users/marpaia/Desktop"
```

## Requirements

The only requirement is that you have Go installed. If you don't have Go
installed and, for some reason, would like to keep it that way, let me know
and I'll upload a nogo binary somewhere for you to download.

You can install go from http://golang.org/doc/install or via a package manager.

## Installation

Use `go get` to install nogo:

```
go get github.com/marpaia/nogo
```

Once you do that, the `nogo` binary will be installed at `$GOPATH/bin`. It's
assumed that if you have a `$GOPATH` set up, that you've also added
`$GOPATH/bin` to your path, but if you haven't, you should do that.

For more information on `GOPATH` and such, refer to http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH

## External dependencies

This project has no external dependencies other than the Go standard library.

## Hacking

If you'd like to customize nogo, do so as you would any other Go project. Use
`go get` as described above to download and install the software, edit the code
in whatever way you see fit, and execute `go install github.com/marpaia/nogo`.

## Areas for improvement

Check out the issues labeled "enhancement" for easy contribution/improvement
ideas. This might be especially interesting to you if you'd like to cut your
teeth contributing to open source software as this is a pretty simple piece of
code that can be improved in a lot of ways.
